			<h1>God's Way Men's Group</h1>
			<p>
				On the first Tuesday of each month at Cowboy Church on the Rock at 6:30p.m. If you enjoy sitting around a table chewing the fat with your friends, you will enjoy our men's group. While God is the center of our conversations, this isn't your typical bible study. We talk about real life problems and what we are doing or have been able to do to fix them. This is no mamby pamby men's group though. We are strong men that recognize a need for Christian fellowship and accountability.
